The account will be verified and notified in your registered mail. If you are facing any issues to signup you can always write to support@greedygame.com. \r\n\r\n**Create a game-id :** As shown in the screenshot click on AdUnit tab and press create new game. Fill in all the details. This will create a new game profile id which needs to be used at the time of\r\nintegration.\r\n> NB: if the game is not yet in playstore then you can use a dummy URL instead of playstore URL.\r\n\r\n**Identifying good ad-spots and uploading assets :** Upload the textures used in your game after you create the game id. You can refer figure 2 point no. 4 for doing this. For each screen that needs a FloatAd unit create a seperate float unit by clicking on create float unit button as shown at point 3.\r\n\r\n> NB : Note down the unit-id generated when you uploaded the textures and the float-id’s that were generated. \r\n\r\n###Lets familiarize the following terms \r\n**Native-Units :** The non clickable textures inside your game that is dynamically branded at runtime. The native unit is directly blended into the in-game textures, so as shown in the figure the size and the overall look and feel of the texture is not changed but rather the ad is blended seamlessly.\r\nFloat-Units : The clickable ad unit from GreedyGame. On click of this button a window opens which basically displays HTML pages. The size shape and position of the float units are dynamic which means it can always be changed from the server side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Engagement Window :** Engagement window is basically a web view activity that displays a webpage, that opens upon clicking the float unit. \r\n**Campaigns :** For clarity during integration lets just think of it as active ads. Campaign is available means ads are available and Campaign Not available means ads are not available. \r\n                 .                            \r\n###GreedyGame helps you monetize in the following 3 platforms. Select your platform \r\n* UNITY\t\t\t\r\n* NATIVE \t\t\t\r\n* COCOS\r\n\r\n###**ARE YOU FACING ISSUES AFTER INTEGRATION ? **\r\nIf you have already integrated the SDK after going through the integration guide and still if you face trouble or if you are stuck with something then verify the integration using the following forms. \r\n####VERIFYING INTEGRATION\r\n* VERIFY UNITY \r\n* VERIFY NATIVE \r\n* VERIFY COCOS \r\nRemember and come back to this verification part if you face troubles after integration.\r\n* PROGUARD SETTINGS\r\n* RECOMMENDED MANIFEST CHANGE\r\n\r\n###NATIVE INTEGRATION GUIDE\r\n\r\n* BASIC SETUP\r\n* INITIALIZATION OF SDK\r\n* NATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION\r\n* FLOAT AD UNIT INTEGRATION\r\n* OTHER UTILITIES METHOD\r\n\r\n**ECLIPSE :** If you are developing the native android project using eclipse then download the SDK from the following link and import the greedy-android-agent project and add it as a library to your project. \r\n\r\n**ANDROID STUDIO :**  If you are on ANDROID STUDIO then find the aar of our SDK inside android-studio-aar folder and then import it as a module and then add it as a dependency to your project.\r\n\r\n**MANIFEST REQUIREMENTS :** Add these to your projects manifest file.\r\n\r\n**BASIC SETUP : ** \r\n \r\n**GAME PROFILE ID :** Put your gameprofile id generated in this step into the Android xml values as string as shown below.\r\n`<resources>`\r\n    \t\t`<string name=\"greedy_game_profile\">11111111</string>`\r\n\t`</resources>`\r\n\r\nINITIALIZATION OF SDK\r\n\r\nGreedyGameAgent - Install : Install the GreedygameAgent in splash screen activity's ( launcher activity ) onCreate() method.\r\npublic static GreedyGameAgent install(Activity activity, IAgentListener agentListener);\r\nGreedyGameAgent ggAgent = GreedyGameAgent.install(this,listener);\r\nGreedyGameAgent - Callbacks From IAgentListener\r\nIMPORTANT : Find the seperate section detailing about IAgentListener  here. \r\nGreedyGameAgent - init() : Initialize GreedyGameAgent and notify it regarding the assets that you are going to use in your game.\r\nStep 1 : Create an array of units that you are using inside your game like shown below. You should be adding both the floatunits and the native units to the array. There are two ways of using the native units as shown in example 1 and 2 respectively.\r\nStep 2 : Call init() function of GreedyGameAgent with the string array you have created and also specify the type of download you want to use.\r\nExample 1 : ( If you want to download the native units by ID )\r\nString[] units = {\"unit-1522\",\"unit-1941\",\"float-1744\",\"float-1743\"};\r\nggAgent.init(units, FetchType.DOWNLOAD_BY_ID);\r\nExample 2 : (If you want to download native units by path )\r\nString[] units = {\"sun.png\",\"moon.png\",\"float-1744\",\"float-1743\"};\r\nggAgent.init(units, FetchType.DOWNLOAD_BY_PATH);\r\nNOTE \r\n1. Float units are always passed with ID's. \r\n2. For each native unit that you upload to panel.greedygame.com a particular unit-id is generated. Use those ID's while DOWNLOADING_BY_ID. \r\n3. Call ggAgent.init() function only inside onCreate of your starting activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION : \r\n\r\nDuring init call we did during initialization we are actually marking all assets that needs to be branded. So in case there is a campaign available, the relevent native units will be downloaded and kept at a certain folder inside the memory of the device. So all you need to do is \r\nCheck whether a campaign is available using function 1 shown below.\r\nIf a campaign is available replace the texture as shown in snippet 1 using function 2.\r\nFunction 1 : public String activeCampaign() : Returns campaign id of currently active and running campaign on device.\r\nFunction 2 : public String getActivePath() :Return path of folder, where assets of activeCampaign is stored. You can use this method to actually replace the default unit with branded texture !\r\n\r\nSNIPPET 1 :\r\nprivate Bitmap getBitmapByResName(GreedyGameAgent ggAgent, String resName) {\r\nFile file = new File(SplashScreenActivity.ggAgent.getActivePath()+ \"/\" + resName);\r\nif (file.exists()) {\r\n       return BitmapFactory.decodeFile(file.getAbsolutePath());\r\n   \t}\r\nreturn null;\r\n    }\r\nThe above snippet will check if a branded unit is available with the name \"resName\". At runtime you can replace your default texture with the branded texture using this utility function as shown below.\r\nImageView home = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.player);\r\n             Bitmap bmp2 = getBitmapByResName(GreedyGameAgent.getInstance(), \"unit-1941\");\r\n             home.setImageBitmap(bmp2);\r\nNote : getActivePath will return null if there is no active theme\r\n\r\nFLOAT-AD-UNIT INTEGRATION :\r\n\r\nInitializing FloatAdLayout(Context context)\r\nConstructs a new instance of FloatAdLayout. Remember to add it to the current activity context as shown in the code snippet below.\r\nFloatAdLayout floatAdLayout = new FloatAdLayout(context);\r\nFrameLayout.LayoutParams params = new FrameLayout.LayoutParams(\r\n                LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\r\n        this.addContentView(floatAdlayout, params);\r\nDisplay float unit :  Once you have initialized floatAdLayout use the following function to display float-ad-unit.\r\nFunction 1 : public void fetchHeadAd(String unit_id) throws AgentInitNotCalledException\r\nWhenever you need to display a float-unit ( clickable unit ) use this function as shown in the snippet below. ( Replace “float-100”  with the appropriate float unit in your game )\r\nSNIPPET 1: floatAdLayout.fetchHeadAd(“float-100”);\r\nunit_id - Float unit id from panel.greedygame.com (e.g 'float-123')\r\nRemove float unit : Whenever you need to hide a float-unit or if you need to load a new float unit then call the below function to remove the previous float unit from screen ! Also make sure that the new float unit that needs to be displayed is fetched after removing the previous float.\r\n/*** Fetching Float Ad unit ***/\r\n\tfloatAdlayout.remove();\r\nOTHER UTILITIES METHOD : \r\n\r\nSet sdk into debug mode\r\npublic void setDebugCampaign(boolean b)\r\nEnable debug logs\r\npublic void setDebugLog(boolean b)\r\nInterface IAgentListener\r\nClass Overview It is used as a callback listener and is passed as an argument for GreedyGameAgent.install() method ( install method )\r\nMethods inside IAgentListener   : \r\nCallback - when GreedyGameAgent gets Initialized \r\nvoid onInit(OnInitEvent response){\r\nif(response == OnInitEvent.CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE) {\r\n    /* no campaign is available at the moment !\r\n     you can proceed with the game or skip to the \r\n    next scene */\r\n    } else if(response ==OnInitEvent.CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE) {\r\n    /*In this case the download would have already begun in the background ! Either you can wait till it completes and you will get a callback in onDownload() function where you can skip to the next scene or you can continue without waiting and ads will appear as and when they are downloaded ! */\r\n    }\r\nOnInitEvent enum contain values in CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE means no campaign is available CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE means there is an active campaign to download or already cached in device.\r\n\r\nCallback - when download of units get complete\r\nvoid onDownload() {\r\n// This callback notifies that the download of assets have been completed ! \r\n}\r\nCalled when new branded contents are downloaded so that new scene can fetch assets from getActivePath(). This function is called after and only after onInit callback.\r\n\r\nCallback - when download of units fail\r\nvoid onError() {\r\n// This callback notifies that the download of assets have failed and no ads can be served in this session !\r\n}\r\nImportant : both onDownload() and onError() are called only after you get a callback on onInit(). If you getCAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE in onInit() function then no further callbacks will be supplied to onSuccess andonError().\r\nCallback - when there are unavailable permissions\r\nvoid onPermissionsUnavailable(ArrayList<String> permissions)\r\nThis method needs to be used only if your game is targeting SDK version 23 or higher. This callback gives a list of permissions that are not available at runtime and is invoked after GreedyGameAgent initialization.\r\nNote : Only performs the check for 4 runtime permissions that are required by GreedyGameSDK.\r\nPermissions that are checked :\r\nManifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\r\nManifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\r\nManifest.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS\r\nManifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\r\nNote : The above strings itself are returned in the argument if they are not available.\r\nSample Implementation of IAgentListener\r\nclass GGListner implements IAgentListener{\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onProgress(float progress) {\r\n        //Use this for showing progress bar\r\n        Log.i(\"GreedyGame Sample\", \"Downloaded = \"+progress+\"%\");\r\n    }\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onDownload() {\r\n            isBranded = true;\r\n    }\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onInit(OnInitEvent response) {\r\n        if(response == OnInitEvent.CAMPAIGN_AVAIALABLE ){\r\n            //waiting for onDownload or onError callback ! \r\n        }else if(response == OnInitEvent.CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAIALABLE ){\r\n            isBranded = false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    @override\r\n    public void onPermissionsUnavailable(ArrayList<String> permissions) {\r\n    }\r\n    @override\r\n    public void onError() {\r\n        isBranded = false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCOS INTEGRATION GUIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC SETUP\r\nINITIALIZATION OF SDK\r\nNATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION\r\nFLOAT AD UNIT INTEGRATION\r\nMARSHMALLOW COMPLIANCE\r\nIMPORTANT TWEAKS\r\n\r\nBASIC SETUP : \r\nDownload Android library project from Current_sdk/proj.android.\r\nYou will find a folder named Classes.In this folder you will find GreedyGameSDK.h . iOS and Android will share this header file. \r\nAdd this to your cocos2d-x project.Put all branded assets under folder Resources/greedygame ​\r\nNote: Resources/greedygame directory should only contain images and no sub-directories\r\nDeclare the following string in strings.xml file under the res/values folder.\r\n<string name=\"greedy_game_profile\">\"your-game-id-without-quotes\"</string>\r\nINITIALIZATION OF SDK\r\nIn your Game's Cocos Android Activity's onCreate() function add the following code. Make sure that this initialization is done only inside onCreate() and not in onResume() or any other activity lifecycle methods.\r\nSnippet 1 : \r\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){\r\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n        AdsGreedyGame.setup(this, Cocos2dxGLSurfaceView.getInstance());\r\n        AdsGreedyGame.setDebug(false);\r\n        AdsGreedyGame.addFloatUnits(\"float-701\");\r\n        AdsGreedyGame.addNativeUnits(\"Projectile.png\");\r\n    }\r\nNote: use addFloatUnits(String floatID) and addNativeUnits(String filenamewithextension) for adding any number of native and float units you want in your game !\r\nFetching Campaigns\r\n​ In your Splash scene (very first scene of game), add following code in method SplashScene::init(). Where onInit and onProgress are callback functions.\r\ngreedygame::GreedyGameSDK::initialize(&onInit, &onProgress);\r\nCALLBACK FUNCTION\r\nonInit\r\nvoid onInit(int event) {\r\n    CCLog( \"> onInit %d\", event);\r\n    /*\r\n     * CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE, -1 = campaign is not available              \r\n     * CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE, 1 = campaign is available \r\n     * CAMPAIGN_DOWNLOADED, 2 = new campaign is Downloaded\r\n     *\r\n     */\r\n    int isBranded = -1;\r\n    if(event == CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE){\r\n        isBranded = 1;\r\n    } else if(event == CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE){\r\n        isBranded = 0;\r\n    } else if(event == CAMPAIGN_DOWNLOADED) {\r\n        isBranded = 1;\r\n    }\r\n​\r\n    if(isBranded == 1){\r\n        greedygame::GreedyGameSDK::fetchAdHead(\"<floating unit-id>\");\r\n        CCDirector *pDirector = CCDirector::sharedDirector();\r\n        CCScene *pScene = HelloWorld::scene();\r\n        pDirector->replaceScene(pScene);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nonProgress\r\nvoid onProgress(float f) {\r\n    CCLog( \"downloadProgress > : %f\", f);\r\n    ostringstream myString;\r\n    myString << \"Loading progress \" << f <<\"%\";\r\n    std::string s = myString.str();\r\n    pLabel->setString(s.c_str());\r\n}\r\nNATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION : \r\nNative branding in cocos are handled by the SDK itself. No additional codes need to be added. The only thing you need to make sure is that all units that needs to be branded are inside the greedygame folder inside assets folder and that you are adding those resource names as shown in this snippet here.\r\n\r\nFLOAT AD UNIT INTEGRATION\r\nFetch floating units\r\nWhenever you want to add a float unit to a scene just use the following function with the float unit id generated earlier.\r\ngreedygame::GreedyGameSDK::fetchAdHead(\"<floating unit-id>\"); ​\r\nRemove floating units\r\nWhenever you want remove a float ad from the screen just call the following function.\r\ngreedygame::GreedyGameSDK::removeAdHead(); ​\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITY - INTEGRATION GUIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC SETUP\r\nINITIALIZATION OF SDK\r\nNATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION\r\nFLOAT AD UNIT INTEGRATION\r\nOTHER UTILITIES METHOD\r\n\r\nBASIC SETUP\r\nDownload unity package from the following github link and import unity package into unity. \r\nGreedyGameConfigPrefab : As shown in the following screenshot create a GreedyGameConfigPrefab. \r\n\r\nFill in the game id in the field.\r\nIn the ad-unit array add all the native and float unit ids.\r\nMake sure that the isDebug box is unchecked before making game live. If isDebug is turned on it will run a test campaign.\r\nTurn on isLazy load if you want the native branding get reflected in between gameplay as and when the units get downloaded.\r\nAdd the configured GreedyGameConfigPrefab to the loading screen. Add GreedyCampaignLoader.cs to the same scene. Make sure that you attach only one GreedyCampaignLoader to the scene.\r\n\r\nNATIVE UNIT INTEGRATION\r\nSelect the GameObject from your scene which uses the texture that was uploaded to the panel.\r\nFrom Inspector panel add component AdUnit or SharedAdUnit.\r\nNow you should see a component added with a yellow colour help box as shown in the screenshot.\r\nSimilarly repeat steps 1 and 2 for all game objects you want.\r\nYou can use AdUnit and Shared AdUnit to change material and sharedMaterials.\r\n\r\nIn the namespace field add the appropriate native ad unit id that you have added into the GreedyGameConfigPrefab. Once you do that the yellow color will change to green which means its good to go !\r\n\r\nFLOAT UNIT INTEGRATION\r\nSelect the scene where you need the FloatAd-Unit to be displayed. Wherever you want to fetch or hide the FloatAd-Unit, just use the following function from GreedyGame.Runtime.Common\r\nTo show FloatAd-Unit\r\nGreedyAdManager.Instance.FetchAdHead (FloatAd_ID);\r\nTo remove FloatAd-Unit\r\nGreedyAdManager.Instance.RemoveAllAdHead ();\r\n\r\nANDROID SETUP\r\n[For users running a version of Unity earlier than 5.0] Navigate to Temp/StagingArea of your project directory and copy AndroidManifest.xml to Assets/Plugins/Android. Add the following tag to the AndroidManifest.xml file:\r\n<activity android:name=\"com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity\" ...>\r\n  ...\r\n  <meta-data android:name=\"unityplayer.ForwardNativeEventsToDalvik\" android:value=\"true\" />\r\n</activity>\r\nAnd set application hardwareAccelerated=true as\r\n<application \r\n   android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\"\r\n....\r\n</application>\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION DOCUMENTATION\r\nGreedyAdManager\r\nusing GreedyGame.Runtime.Common;\r\nusing GreedyGame.Platform;\r\nPublic Singleton Constructors\r\nGreedyAdManager.Instance\r\nExample\r\nprivate GreedyAdManager ggAdManager = null;\r\nvoid Awake(){\r\n//Initialization as singleton\r\n  ggAdManager = GreedyAdManager.Instance;\r\n}\r\n\r\nCALLBACK METHOD IN WRAPPER : unAvailablePermissions(ArrayList permissions)\r\nThis method needs to be used only if your game is targetting SDK version 23 or higher. This callback gives a list of permissions that are not available at runtime and is invoked after GreedyGameAgent initialization.\r\nIMPORTANT : Unity takes care of dangerous permissions on its own at runtime. Use this callback function only if you are not using Unity Runtime Permission facility. NB : Only performs check for 4 dangerous permissions that are required by GreedyGameSDK.\r\nPermissions that are checked :\r\nManifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\r\nManifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\r\nManifest.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS\r\nManifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\r\nNB : The above strings itself are returned in the argument if they are not available.\r\nInit\r\ninit(String GameId, String[] AdUnits, Boolean isDebug, Boolean isLazyLoad, OnGreedyEvent)\r\nLookup for new native campaign from server.\r\nGameId - Unique game profile id from panel.greedygame.com\r\nAdUnits - Array register unit id. eg. Unit-XYZ\r\nisDebug- To build debug app for testing\r\nisLazyLoad- In case of true, it will show branded assets as soon as downloaded\r\nOnGreedyEvent - Callback function for RuntimeEvent as follow:\r\nCAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE : if currently no campaign is available.\r\nCAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE : if a campaign is available and ready for download.\r\nCAMPAIGN_DOWNLOADED : callback after campaign is available and assets have been downloaded.\r\nCAMPAIGN_DOWNLOAD_ERROR : callback after campaign is available but failed before complete download.\r\nExample\r\nvoid Start() {\r\n  if (isSupported) {\r\n    GlobalConfig[] ggLoaders = Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll<GlobalConfig> ();\r\n    if(ggLoaders != null && ggLoaders.Length != 1){\r\n      isSupported = false;\r\n      Debug.LogError(\"None or multuple occurrence of GlobalConfig object found!\");\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    GlobalConfig ggConfig = ggLoaders [0];\r\n    ggAdManager.init (ggConfig.GameId, ggConfig.AdUnits.ToArray (), ggConfig.isDebug, ggConfig.isLazyLoad, OnGreedyEvent);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nOnGreedyEvent\r\nvoid OnGreedyEvent(RuntimeEvent greedy_events)\r\nCallback function for RuntimeEvent\r\nExample\r\nvoid OnGreedyEvent(RuntimeEvent greedy_events){\r\n  if (greedy_events == RuntimeEvent.CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE || \r\n      greedy_events == RuntimeEvent.CAMPAIGN_DOWNLOAD_ERROR) {\r\n  //Goto play scene if server reponse is recevied\r\n    Application.LoadLevel (PostLevel);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSHMALLOW COMPLIANCE : \r\nCALLBACK METHOD IN GreedyAndroidAgent project WRAPPER : onPermissionsUnavailable(ArrayList permissions)\r\nThis method needs to be used only if your game is targetting SDK version 23 or higher. This callback gives a list of permissions that are not available at runtime and is invoked after GreedyGameAgent initialization. ​\r\n NB : Only performs check for 4 runtime permissions that are required by GreedyGameSDK. ​ Permissions that are checked : ​\r\nManifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\r\nManifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\r\nManifest.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS\r\nManifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE ​ NB : The above strings itself are returned in the argument if they are not available.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT TWEAKS : \r\nExiting the Game\r\nIf you are using the following function to exit from the game \r\nexit(0) ;\r\nCCDirector::sharedDirector()->end(); \r\nthen you should make sure that you are calling the below function just before exiting greedygame::GreedyGameSDK::unInstall();\r\n\r\nPROGUARD SETTINGS\r\nIf you are using Proguard add the following to your Proguard settings !\r\n-keep class com.greedygame.android.** { *;}\r\n-keepattributes JavascriptInterface\r\n-keepclassmembers class * {\r\n    @android.webkit.JavascriptInterface <methods>;\r\n }\r\nRecommended Manifest changes\r\nThe GreedyGame SDK is connected with the activity lifecycle of your game. Generally Games works in either portrait or landscape mode for consistent user experience. Hence it is advisable not to recreate the activity on config changes which may happen due to power button press etc.\r\nTo avoid this immediate activity creation and destroying overhead, add the following configChanges in the Manifest file.\r\n<activity\r\n android:name=\"com.package.YourActivity\"\r\nandroid:configChanges=\"keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|layoutDirection\">\r\n</activity>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an optimization . The SDK will handle all related changes if your game supports multiple orientations.\r\nMANIFEST REQUIREMENTS : Add the following into the manifest of your project.\r\n<application>\r\n<!-- GreedyGame SDK's requirements start -->\r\n   <activity\r\n android:name=\"com.greedygame.android.adhead.GGAdHeadActivity\"\r\nandroid:configChanges=\"keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|layoutDirection\"\r\n android:launchMode=\"singleTask\"\r\n android:theme=\"@style/Theme.Transparent\">\r\n  </activity>\r\n    <receiver\r\n android:name=\"com.greedygame.android.agent.GreedyRefReceiver\"\r\n android:enabled=\"true\"\r\n android:exported=\"true\">\r\n<intent-filter>\r\n<action android:name=\"com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\"/>\r\n<action android:name=\"android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE\"/>\r\n<action android:name=\"com.greedygame.broadcast\"/>\r\n</intent-filter>\r\n</receiver><!-- GreedyGame SDK's requirements end -->\r\n</application>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
