<p><strong>Signup :</strong> 
Go to publisher.greedygame.com and signup for a greedygame account. The account will be verified and notified in your registered mail. If you are facing any issues to signup you can always write to <a href="mailto:support@greedygame.com">support@greedygame.com</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Create a game-id :</strong> As shown in the screenshot click on AdUnit tab and press create new game. Fill in all the details. This will create a new game profile id which needs to be used at the time of
integration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NB: if the game is not yet in playstore then you can use a dummy URL instead of playstore URL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Identifying good ad-spots and uploading assets :</strong> Upload the textures used in your game after you create the game id. You can refer figure 2 point no. 4 for doing this. For each screen that needs a FloatAd unit create a seperate float unit by clicking on create float unit button as shown at point 3.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NB : Note down the unit-id generated when you uploaded the textures and the float-id’s that were generated. </p>

<p><strong>Native-Units :</strong> The non clickable textures inside your game that is dynamically branded at runtime. The native unit is directly blended into the in-game textures, so as shown in the figure the size and the overall look and feel of the texture is not changed but rather the ad is blended seamlessly.
Float-Units : The clickable ad unit from GreedyGame. On click of this button a window opens which basically displays HTML pages. The size shape and position of the float units are dynamic which means it can always be changed from the server side.</p>

<p><strong>Engagement Window :</strong> Engagement window is basically a web view activity that displays a webpage, that opens upon clicking the float unit. 
<strong>Campaigns :</strong> For clarity during integration lets just think of it as active ads. Campaign is available means ads are available and Campaign Not available means ads are not available. 
                 .                            </p>

</ul>

<p><strong>ECLIPSE :</strong> If you are developing the native android project using eclipse then download the SDK from the following link and import the greedy-android-agent project and add it as a library to your project. </p>

<p><strong>ANDROID STUDIO :</strong>  If you are on ANDROID STUDIO then find the aar of our SDK inside android-studio-aar folder and then import it as a module and then add it as a dependency to your project.</p>

<p><strong>MANIFEST REQUIREMENTS :</strong> Add these to your projects manifest file.</p>

<p>*<em>BASIC SETUP : *</em> </p>

<p><strong>GAME PROFILE ID :</strong> Put your gameprofile id generated in this step into the Android xml values as string as shown below.
<code>&lt;resources&gt;</code>
            <code>&lt;string name="greedy_game_profile"&gt;11111111&lt;/string&gt;</code>
    <code>&lt;/resources&gt;</code></p>

<p>INITIALIZATION OF SDK</p>

<p>GreedyGameAgent - Install : Install the GreedygameAgent in splash screen activity's ( launcher activity ) onCreate() method.
public static GreedyGameAgent install(Activity activity, IAgentListener agentListener);
GreedyGameAgent ggAgent = GreedyGameAgent.install(this,listener);
GreedyGameAgent - Callbacks From IAgentListener
IMPORTANT : Find the seperate section detailing about IAgentListener  here. 
GreedyGameAgent - init() : Initialize GreedyGameAgent and notify it regarding the assets that you are going to use in your game.
Step 1 : Create an array of units that you are using inside your game like shown below. You should be adding both the floatunits and the native units to the array. There are two ways of using the native units as shown in example 1 and 2 respectively.
Step 2 : Call init() function of GreedyGameAgent with the string array you have created and also specify the type of download you want to use.
Example 1 : ( If you want to download the native units by ID )
String[] units = {"unit-1522","unit-1941","float-1744","float-1743"};
ggAgent.init(units, FetchType.DOWNLOAD_BY_ID);
Example 2 : (If you want to download native units by path )
String[] units = {"sun.png","moon.png","float-1744","float-1743"};
ggAgent.init(units, FetchType.DOWNLOAD_BY_PATH);
NOTE 
1. Float units are always passed with ID's. 
2. For each native unit that you upload to panel.greedygame.com a particular unit-id is generated. Use those ID's while DOWNLOADING_BY_ID. 
3. Call ggAgent.init() function only inside onCreate of your starting activity.</p>

<p>NATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION : </p>

<p>During init call we did during initialization we are actually marking all assets that needs to be branded. So in case there is a campaign available, the relevent native units will be downloaded and kept at a certain folder inside the memory of the device. So all you need to do is 
Check whether a campaign is available using function 1 shown below.
If a campaign is available replace the texture as shown in snippet 1 using function 2.
Function 1 : public String activeCampaign() : Returns campaign id of currently active and running campaign on device.
Function 2 : public String getActivePath() :Return path of folder, where assets of activeCampaign is stored. You can use this method to actually replace the default unit with branded texture !</p>

<p>SNIPPET 1 :
private Bitmap getBitmapByResName(GreedyGameAgent ggAgent, String resName) {
File file = new File(SplashScreenActivity.ggAgent.getActivePath()+ "/" + resName);
if (file.exists()) {
       return BitmapFactory.decodeFile(file.getAbsolutePath());
    }
return null;
    }
The above snippet will check if a branded unit is available with the name "resName". At runtime you can replace your default texture with the branded texture using this utility function as shown below.
ImageView home = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.player);
             Bitmap bmp2 = getBitmapByResName(GreedyGameAgent.getInstance(), "unit-1941");
             home.setImageBitmap(bmp2);
Note : getActivePath will return null if there is no active theme</p>

<p>FLOAT-AD-UNIT INTEGRATION :</p>

<p>Initializing FloatAdLayout(Context context)
Constructs a new instance of FloatAdLayout. Remember to add it to the current activity context as shown in the code snippet below.
FloatAdLayout floatAdLayout = new FloatAdLayout(context);
FrameLayout.LayoutParams params = new FrameLayout.LayoutParams(
                LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
        this.addContentView(floatAdlayout, params);
Display float unit :  Once you have initialized floatAdLayout use the following function to display float-ad-unit.
Function 1 : public void fetchHeadAd(String unit_id) throws AgentInitNotCalledException
Whenever you need to display a float-unit ( clickable unit ) use this function as shown in the snippet below. ( Replace “float-100”  with the appropriate float unit in your game )
SNIPPET 1: floatAdLayout.fetchHeadAd(“float-100”);
unit_id - Float unit id from panel.greedygame.com (e.g 'float-123')
Remove float unit : Whenever you need to hide a float-unit or if you need to load a new float unit then call the below function to remove the previous float unit from screen ! Also make sure that the new float unit that needs to be displayed is fetched after removing the previous float.
/*** Fetching Float Ad unit ***/
    floatAdlayout.remove();
OTHER UTILITIES METHOD : </p>

<p>Set sdk into debug mode
public void setDebugCampaign(boolean b)
Enable debug logs
public void setDebugLog(boolean b)
Interface IAgentListener
Class Overview It is used as a callback listener and is passed as an argument for GreedyGameAgent.install() method ( install method )
Methods inside IAgentListener   : 
Callback - when GreedyGameAgent gets Initialized 
void onInit(OnInitEvent response){
if(response == OnInitEvent.CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE) {
    /* no campaign is available at the moment !
     you can proceed with the game or skip to the 
    next scene <em>/
    } else if(response ==OnInitEvent.CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE) {
    /</em>In this case the download would have already begun in the background ! Either you can wait till it completes and you will get a callback in onDownload() function where you can skip to the next scene or you can continue without waiting and ads will appear as and when they are downloaded ! */
    }
OnInitEvent enum contain values in CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE means no campaign is available CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE means there is an active campaign to download or already cached in device.</p>

<p>Callback - when download of units get complete
void onDownload() {
// This callback notifies that the download of assets have been completed ! 
}
Called when new branded contents are downloaded so that new scene can fetch assets from getActivePath(). This function is called after and only after onInit callback.</p>

<p>Callback - when download of units fail
void onError() {
// This callback notifies that the download of assets have failed and no ads can be served in this session !
}
Important : both onDownload() and onError() are called only after you get a callback on onInit(). If you getCAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE in onInit() function then no further callbacks will be supplied to onSuccess andonError().
Callback - when there are unavailable permissions
void onPermissionsUnavailable(ArrayList permissions)
This method needs to be used only if your game is targeting SDK version 23 or higher. This callback gives a list of permissions that are not available at runtime and is invoked after GreedyGameAgent initialization.
Note : Only performs the check for 4 runtime permissions that are required by GreedyGameSDK.
Permissions that are checked :
Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
Manifest.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS
Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
Note : The above strings itself are returned in the argument if they are not available.
Sample Implementation of IAgentListener
class GGListner implements IAgentListener{
    <a href="https://github.com/Override" class="user-mention">@Override</a>
    public void onProgress(float progress) {
        //Use this for showing progress bar
        Log.i("GreedyGame Sample", "Downloaded = "+progress+"%");
    }
    <a href="https://github.com/Override" class="user-mention">@Override</a>

        if(response == OnInitEvent.CAMPAIGN_AVAIALABLE ){
            //waiting for onDownload or onError callback ! 
        }else if(response == OnInitEvent.CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAIALABLE ){
            isBranded = false;
        }
    }

<p>COCOS INTEGRATION GUIDE</p>

<p>BASIC SETUP
INITIALIZATION OF SDK
NATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION
FLOAT AD UNIT INTEGRATION
MARSHMALLOW COMPLIANCE
IMPORTANT TWEAKS</p>

<p>BASIC SETUP : 
Download Android library project from Current_sdk/proj.android.
You will find a folder named Classes.In this folder you will find GreedyGameSDK.h . iOS and Android will share this header file. 
Add this to your cocos2d-x project.Put all branded assets under folder Resources/greedygame ​
Note: Resources/greedygame directory should only contain images and no sub-directories
Declare the following string in strings.xml file under the res/values folder.
"your-game-id-without-quotes"
INITIALIZATION OF SDK
In your Game's Cocos Android Activity's onCreate() function add the following code. Make sure that this initialization is done only inside onCreate() and not in onResume() or any other activity lifecycle methods.
Snippet 1 : 
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        AdsGreedyGame.setup(this, Cocos2dxGLSurfaceView.getInstance());
        AdsGreedyGame.setDebug(false);
        AdsGreedyGame.addFloatUnits("float-701");
        AdsGreedyGame.addNativeUnits("Projectile.png");
    }
Note: use addFloatUnits(String floatID) and addNativeUnits(String filenamewithextension) for adding any number of native and float units you want in your game !
Fetching Campaigns
​ In your Splash scene (very first scene of game), add following code in method SplashScene::init(). Where onInit and onProgress are callback functions.
greedygame::GreedyGameSDK::initialize(&amp;onInit, &amp;onProgress);
CALLBACK FUNCTION
onInit
void onInit(int event) {
    CCLog( "&gt; onInit %d", event);
    /*
     * CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE, -1 = campaign is not available<br>
     * CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE, 1 = campaign is available 
     * CAMPAIGN_DOWNLOADED, 2 = new campaign is Downloaded
     *
     */
    int isBranded = -1;
    if(event == CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE){
        isBranded = 1;
    } else if(event == CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE){
        isBranded = 0;
    } else if(event == CAMPAIGN_DOWNLOADED) {
        isBranded = 1;
    }
​
    if(isBranded == 1){
        greedygame::GreedyGameSDK::fetchAdHead("");
        CCDirector *pDirector = CCDirector::sharedDirector();
        CCScene *pScene = HelloWorld::scene();
        pDirector-&gt;replaceScene(pScene);
    }
}
onProgress
void onProgress(float f) {
    CCLog( "downloadProgress &gt; : %f", f);
    ostringstream myString;
    myString &lt;&lt; "Loading progress " &lt;&lt; f &lt;&lt;"%";
    std::string s = myString.str();
    pLabel-&gt;setString(s.c_str());
}
NATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION : 
Native branding in cocos are handled by the SDK itself. No additional codes need to be added. The only thing you need to make sure is that all units that needs to be branded are inside the greedygame folder inside assets folder and that you are adding those resource names as shown in this snippet here.</p>

<p>FLOAT AD UNIT INTEGRATION
Fetch floating units
Whenever you want to add a float unit to a scene just use the following function with the float unit id generated earlier.
greedygame::GreedyGameSDK::fetchAdHead(""); ​
Remove floating units
Whenever you want remove a float ad from the screen just call the following function.
greedygame::GreedyGameSDK::removeAdHead(); ​</p>

<p>UNITY - INTEGRATION GUIDE</p>

<p>BASIC SETUP
INITIALIZATION OF SDK
NATIVE AD UNIT INTEGRATION
FLOAT AD UNIT INTEGRATION
OTHER UTILITIES METHOD</p>

<p>BASIC SETUP
Download unity package from the following github link and import unity package into unity. 
GreedyGameConfigPrefab : As shown in the following screenshot create a GreedyGameConfigPrefab. </p>

<p>Fill in the game id in the field.
In the ad-unit array add all the native and float unit ids.
Make sure that the isDebug box is unchecked before making game live. If isDebug is turned on it will run a test campaign.
Turn on isLazy load if you want the native branding get reflected in between gameplay as and when the units get downloaded.
Add the configured GreedyGameConfigPrefab to the loading screen. Add GreedyCampaignLoader.cs to the same scene. Make sure that you attach only one GreedyCampaignLoader to the scene.</p>

<p>NATIVE UNIT INTEGRATION
Select the GameObject from your scene which uses the texture that was uploaded to the panel.
From Inspector panel add component AdUnit or SharedAdUnit.
Now you should see a component added with a yellow colour help box as shown in the screenshot.
Similarly repeat steps 1 and 2 for all game objects you want.
You can use AdUnit and Shared AdUnit to change material and sharedMaterials.</p>

<p>In the namespace field add the appropriate native ad unit id that you have added into the GreedyGameConfigPrefab. Once you do that the yellow color will change to green which means its good to go !</p>

<p>FLOAT UNIT INTEGRATION
Select the scene where you need the FloatAd-Unit to be displayed. Wherever you want to fetch or hide the FloatAd-Unit, just use the following function from GreedyGame.Runtime.Common
To show FloatAd-Unit
GreedyAdManager.Instance.FetchAdHead (FloatAd_ID);
To remove FloatAd-Unit
GreedyAdManager.Instance.RemoveAllAdHead ();</p>

<p>ANDROID SETUP
[For users running a version of Unity earlier than 5.0] Navigate to Temp/StagingArea of your project directory and copy AndroidManifest.xml to Assets/Plugins/Android. Add the following tag to the AndroidManifest.xml file:

  ...
  

And set application hardwareAccelerated=true as
</p>

<p>ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION DOCUMENTATION
GreedyAdManager
using GreedyGame.Runtime.Common;
using GreedyGame.Platform;
Public Singleton Constructors
GreedyAdManager.Instance
Example
private GreedyAdManager ggAdManager = null;
void Awake(){
//Initialization as singleton
  ggAdManager = GreedyAdManager.Instance;
}</p>

<p>CALLBACK METHOD IN WRAPPER : unAvailablePermissions(ArrayList permissions)
This method needs to be used only if your game is targetting SDK version 23 or higher. This callback gives a list of permissions that are not available at runtime and is invoked after GreedyGameAgent initialization.
IMPORTANT : Unity takes care of dangerous permissions on its own at runtime. Use this callback function only if you are not using Unity Runtime Permission facility. NB : Only performs check for 4 dangerous permissions that are required by GreedyGameSDK.
Permissions that are checked :
Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
Manifest.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS
Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
NB : The above strings itself are returned in the argument if they are not available.
Init
init(String GameId, String[] AdUnits, Boolean isDebug, Boolean isLazyLoad, OnGreedyEvent)
Lookup for new native campaign from server.
GameId - Unique game profile id from panel.greedygame.com
AdUnits - Array register unit id. eg. Unit-XYZ
isDebug- To build debug app for testing
isLazyLoad- In case of true, it will show branded assets as soon as downloaded
OnGreedyEvent - Callback function for RuntimeEvent as follow:
CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE : if currently no campaign is available.
CAMPAIGN_AVAILABLE : if a campaign is available and ready for download.
CAMPAIGN_DOWNLOADED : callback after campaign is available and assets have been downloaded.
CAMPAIGN_DOWNLOAD_ERROR : callback after campaign is available but failed before complete download.
Example
void Start() {
  if (isSupported) {
    GlobalConfig[] ggLoaders = Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll ();
    if(ggLoaders != null &amp;&amp; ggLoaders.Length != 1){
      isSupported = false;
      Debug.LogError("None or multuple occurrence of GlobalConfig object found!");
      return;
    }
    GlobalConfig ggConfig = ggLoaders [0];
    ggAdManager.init (ggConfig.GameId, ggConfig.AdUnits.ToArray (), ggConfig.isDebug, ggConfig.isLazyLoad, OnGreedyEvent);
  }
}</p>

<p>OnGreedyEvent
void OnGreedyEvent(RuntimeEvent greedy_events)
Callback function for RuntimeEvent
Example
void OnGreedyEvent(RuntimeEvent greedy_events){
  if (greedy_events == RuntimeEvent.CAMPAIGN_NOT_AVAILABLE || 
      greedy_events == RuntimeEvent.CAMPAIGN_DOWNLOAD_ERROR) {
  //Goto play scene if server reponse is recevied
    Application.LoadLevel (PostLevel);
  }
}</p>

<p>MARSHMALLOW COMPLIANCE : 
CALLBACK METHOD IN GreedyAndroidAgent project WRAPPER : onPermissionsUnavailable(ArrayList permissions)
This method needs to be used only if your game is targetting SDK version 23 or higher. This callback gives a list of permissions that are not available at runtime and is invoked after GreedyGameAgent initialization. ​
 NB : Only performs check for 4 runtime permissions that are required by GreedyGameSDK. ​ Permissions that are checked : ​
Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
Manifest.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS
Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE ​ NB : The above strings itself are returned in the argument if they are not available.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT TWEAKS : 
Exiting the Game
If you are using the following function to exit from the game 
exit(0) ;
CCDirector::sharedDirector()-&gt;end(); 
then you should make sure that you are calling the below function just before exiting greedygame::GreedyGameSDK::unInstall();</p>

<p>PROGUARD SETTINGS
If you are using Proguard add the following to your Proguard settings !
-keep class com.greedygame.android.** { *;}
-keepattributes JavascriptInterface
-keepclassmembers class * {
    @android.webkit.JavascriptInterface ;
 }
Recommended Manifest changes
The GreedyGame SDK is connected with the activity lifecycle of your game. Generally Games works in either portrait or landscape mode for consistent user experience. Hence it is advisable not to recreate the activity on config changes which may happen due to power button press etc.
To avoid this immediate activity creation and destroying overhead, add the following configChanges in the Manifest file.

</p>

<p>This is an optimization . The SDK will handle all related changes if your game supports multiple orientations.
MANIFEST REQUIREMENTS : Add the following into the manifest of your project.
</p>
